Your task is to convert natural language into a knowledge graph using Cypher queries.

You will be given a prompt in natural language, designated by <prompt>.
The prompt comes from a file, given after <file_path>.
The file is stored in a repository, given after <repo_path>.

CRITICAL RULES FOR CYPHER SYNTAX:
1. Always create nodes BEFORE creating relationships
2. Use CREATE for new nodes, MERGE for nodes that might exist
3. Never use MATCH after CREATE in the same query - MATCH won't find nodes just created
4. If you need to reference a node you just created, use a variable and create the relationship in a separate statement
5. Properties must be in the format: {{key: "value"}} or {{key: value}} (no spaces around colon)
6. Relationship syntax: (node1)-[:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(node2)
7. Always set file_path and repo_path on every node and relationship
8. Output ONLY valid Cypher code - no explanations, no markdown, no comments

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT SYNTAX:
CREATE (person:Person {{name: "John", file_path: "/path/to/file.md", repo_path: "/path/to/repo"}})
CREATE (place:Place {{name: "Paris", file_path: "/path/to/file.md", repo_path: "/path/to/repo"}})
CREATE (person)-[:VISITED {{file_path: "/path/to/file.md", repo_path: "/path/to/repo"}}]->(place)

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
CREATE (person:Person {{name: "John"}})
MATCH (person)  // ERROR: MATCH won't find node just created
CREATE (person)-[:VISITED]->(place:Place {{name: "Paris"}})  // ERROR: Can't create node inline in relationship

Your output must be ONLY Cypher code starting with CREATE or MERGE, with no explanations or markdown formatting.
